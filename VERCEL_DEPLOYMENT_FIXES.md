# Vercel Deployment Fixes for Black Hole Simulation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cross-Origin Policy Issues
**Problem**: Vercel's strict CORS policies were preventing iframe communication and asset loading.

**Solution**: Updated `vercel.json` to use less restrictive CORS policies:
- Changed `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` from `credentialless` to `unsafe-none`
- Changed `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` from `same-origin-allow-popups` to `unsafe-none`
- Added `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` for iframe security
- Reduced cache time from 1 year to 1 hour for easier debugging

### 2. Asset Loading Failures
**Problem**: Shader files and textures were failing to load on deployment due to CORS restrictions.

**Solution**: Enhanced asset loading in `blackhole_js.js`:
- Added proper CORS headers for HTTPS requests
- Implemented cache busting with timestamps
- Added graceful fallback to procedural textures when assets fail to load
- Enhanced error handling to prevent crashes

### 3. Message Passing Issues
**Problem**: The React component wasn't receiving the 'blackhole-loaded' message from the iframe.

**Solution**: 
- Added message dispatch in `blackhole_js.js` after successful initialization
- Enhanced message validation in `BlackHoleEntrance.tsx` to accept messages from iframe
- Added multiple fallback timeouts (3s and 8s) for deployment scenarios

### 4. WebGL Context Issues
**Problem**: WebGL context creation might fail on some deployment environments.

**Solution**: Enhanced WebGL compatibility:
- Added deployment-specific fetch options with proper headers
- Improved error handling for texture loading
- Added fallback mechanisms for failed asset loads

## Files Modified

1. **`vercel.json`**: Updated CORS policies for iframe compatibility
2. **`public/blackhole/blackhole_js.js`**: Enhanced asset loading and message passing
3. **`src/components/BlackHoleEntrance.tsx`**: Improved message handling and fallbacks

## Testing

The fixes ensure that:
- ✅ Black hole simulation loads on Vercel deployment
- ✅ Iframe communication works properly
- ✅ Assets load with proper CORS handling
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms prevent infinite loading states
- ✅ WebGL context creation is more robust

## Deployment Notes

- The simulation will now show loading indicators and fallback to UI display even if some assets fail
- Console logs will show detailed information about loading progress and any issues
- The simulation gracefully degrades to procedural textures if external assets fail to load
